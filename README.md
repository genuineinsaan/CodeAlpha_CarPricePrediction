# CodeAlpha_CarPricePrediction

## 🚗 Project: Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Internship** program. The goal of this task was to build a regression model that predicts the **selling price of used cars** based on features like mileage, fuel type, brand value, and ownership status.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Predict used car prices using historical data  
- Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization  
- Apply a **regression model** (Linear Regression)  
- Evaluate the model using metrics like **R² Score** and **MSE**

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
